==========


NAME
----
zmq_ipc - 0MQ transport to pass messages between processes


SYNOPSIS
--------
Inter-process transport is optimised for passing messages between processes on
the same physical machine.


CONNECTION STRING
-----------------
Connection string for inter-process transport is "ipc://" followed by a file
name. The file will be used as placeholder for a message endpoint. (UNIX domain
sockets associate a file with the listening socket in a similar way.)

----
    ipc:///tmp/my_ipc_endpoint
    ipc:///tmp/prices.ipc
----


WIRE FORMAT
-----------
IPC transport doesn't transfer messages across the network thus there is no need
for a wire format specification.
