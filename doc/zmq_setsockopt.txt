zmq_setsockopt(3)
=================


NAME
----

zmq_setsockopt - sets a specified option on a 0MQ socket


SYNOPSIS
--------
'int zmq_setsockopt (void *s, int option, const void *optval, size_t optvallen);'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Sets an option on the socket. 'option' argument specifies the option from the
list below. 'optval' is a pointer to the value to set, 'optvallen' is the size
of the value in bytes.

*ZMQ_HWM*::
High watermark for the message pipes associated with the socket. The water
mark cannot be exceeded. If the messages don't fit into the pipe emergency
mechanisms of the particular socket type are used (block, drop etc.) If HWM
is set to zero, there are no limits for the content of the pipe.
+
Type: int64_t  Unit: messages  Default: 0

*ZMQ_LWM*::
Low watermark makes sense only if high watermark is defined (i.e. is non-zero).
When the emergency state is reached when messages overflow the pipe, the
emergency lasts at most till the size of the pipe decreases to low watermark.
Normal state is resumed at that point.
+
Type: int64_t  Unit: messages  Default: 0

*ZMQ_SWAP*::
Swap allows the pipe to exceed high watermark. However, the data are written
to the disk rather than held in the memory. Until high watermark is
exceeded there is no disk activity involved though. The value of the option
defines maximal size of the swap file.
+
Type: int64_t  Unit: bytes  Default: 0

*ZMQ_AFFINITY*::
Affinity defines which threads in the thread pool will be used to handle
newly created sockets. This way you can dedicate some of the threads (CPUs)
to a specific work. Value of 0 means no affinity. Work is distributed
fairly among the threads in the thread pool. For non-zero values, the lowest
bit corresponds to the thread 1, second lowest bit to the thread 2 etc.
Thus, value of 3 means that from now on newly created sockets will handle
I/O activity exclusively using threads no. 1 and 2.
+
Type: int64_t  Unit: N/A (bitmap)  Default: 0

*ZMQ_IDENTITY*::
Identity of the socket. Identity is important when restarting applications.
If the socket has no identity, each run of the application is completely
separated from other runs. However, with identity application reconnects to
existing infrastructure left by the previous run. Thus it may receive
messages that were sent in the meantime, it shares pipe limits with the
previous run etc. Identity should be at least one byte and at most 255 bytes
long. Identities starting with binary zero are reserver for use by 0MQ
infrastructure.
+
Type: BLOB  Unit: N/A  Default: NULL

*ZMQ_SUBSCRIBE*::
Applicable only to ZMQ_SUB socket type. It establishes new message filter.
When ZMQ_SUB socket is created all the incoming messages are filtered out.
This option allows you to subscribe for all messages (""), or messages 
beginning with specific prefix (e.g. "animals.mammals.dogs."). Multiple
filters can be attached to a single 'sub' socket. In that case message passes
if it matches at least one of the filters.
+
Type: BLOB  Unit: N/A  Default: N/A

*ZMQ_UNSUBSCRIBE*::
Applicable only to ZMQ_SUB socket type. Removes existing message filter.
The filter specified must match the string passed to ZMQ_SUBSCRIBE options
exactly. If there were several instances of the same filter created,
this options removes only one of them, leaving the rest in place
and functional.
+
Type: BLOB  Unit: N/A  Default: N/A

*ZMQ_RATE*::
This option applies only to sending side of multicast transports (pgm & udp).
It specifies maximal outgoing data rate that an individual sender socket
can send.
+
Type: uint64_t  Unit: kilobits/second  Default: 100

*ZMQ_RECOVERY_IVL*::
This option applies only to multicast transports (pgm & udp). It specifies
how long can the receiver socket survive when the sender is inaccessible.
Keep in mind that large recovery intervals at high data rates result in
very large recovery buffers, meaning that you can easily overload your box
by setting say 1 minute recovery interval at 1Gb/s rate (requires
7GB in-memory buffer).
+
Type: uint64_t Unit: seconds Default: 10 

*ZMQ_MCAST_LOOP*::
This option applies only to multicast transports (pgm & udp). Value of 1
means that the mutlicast packets can be received on the box they were sent
from. Setting the value to 0 disables the loopback functionality which
can have negative impact on the performance. If possible, disable
the loopback in production environments.
+
Type: uint64_t Unit: N/A (boolean value) Default: 1

*ZMQ_SNDBUF*::
Sets the underlying kernel transmit buffer size to the specified size. See
'SO_SNDBUF' POSIX socket option. Value of zero means leaving the OS default
unchanged.
+
Type: uint64_t Unit: bytes Default: 0

*ZMQ_RCVBUF*::
Sets the underlying kernel receive buffer size to the specified size. See
'SO_RCVBUF' POSIX socket option. Value of zero means leaving the OS default
unchanged.
+
Type: uint64_t Unit: bytes Default: 0


RETURN VALUE
------------
In case of success the function returns zero. Otherwise it returns -1 and
sets 'errno' to the appropriate value.


ERRORS
------
*EINVAL*::
unknown option, a value with incorrect length or invalid value.
